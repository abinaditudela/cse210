Version Control - Articulate
Adan Abinadi Tudela

What is version control and why is it important?

For me a version control system, or VCS, is a proccess that tracks history of changes as people and teams collaborate on projects together.
As a developer tracking on this sytem I can find out versions of the project to be recovered at any time.

    so the first benefit is to keep track of the history of your project you are working on.
    Version control makes very easy to work simoustaneously in the same project with others developers.
    Also you can revert to a previous version in the project if you had make a mistake.

An example of version control is github, its a big plataform that allows you and the people you want to work together tracking the history of a project.
to start and config a repository i love the command:
     git config --global user.name "yourusername"
     git init   = it creates a new repository

thank you
